## Prolong life of a cooler pump

Dry-running protection for water pumps is one of the most important monitoring functions, as
bearings and shaft seal may be damaged if the booster pumps run dry. So Stop water cooler
damage with dry running protection is made. With this method, we can prevent our water
cooler’s motor from dry running and activate it for about one-third of the time only. This will
reduce the wear and tear of the motor and save electricity too. Coolers are used in many homes,
offices, schools, and industries, especially in summer.
 So this device will come in handy to stop the cooler pump automatically when the
cooler’s tank has no water.
